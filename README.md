**- What is this?**

Just a simple repository with no actual defined purpose by itself, it serves more as a museum of my codes, a way to store my progress in learning how to program from the very beginning.

**- Can I use anything here?**

I don't give permission to use anything stored here unless the proper credits are given (not that anything here is THAT useful, just being sure).

Lastly, because I'm a student and it might happen one day, I also don't give permission to use anything stored here if your intentions are to get grades in any discipline (even if you credit me), but feel free to try and use it as a learning tool (not that my codes are the prettiest right now but....).

**- Quick note:**

The majority of this repository is written in portuguese (excluding the codes itself), so I recommend knowing it or using a translator to better understand the organization and "what's being solved".

Please don't abuse anything, and thank you for taking your time to read all of this.
