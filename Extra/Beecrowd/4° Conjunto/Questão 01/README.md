Cesar is a detective who investigates a series of robberies that happen in his city. Everywhere a crime happens, the person who committed such a crime leaves a written message, consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters. Cesar was able to find a pattern in these messages and now extracts hidden text from each message and asks for his help in trying to find out who is committing such crimes.
