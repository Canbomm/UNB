The Sudoku puzzle spread quickly across the world, being the most popular hobby in the planet today. Some people, however, fill the matrix incorrectly, breaking the rules. Your task is to write a program that checks whether a filled matrix is a solution to the puzzle or not.

The matrix is a 9 x 9 matrix of integers. To be considered a solution to the puzzle, each row and each column must contain all integer numbers between 1 and 9. Also, if the matrix is partitioned in nine 3 x 3 sub-matrices (as shown below), each one of them must also contain all numbers between 1 and 9. The following matrix is an example of a solution to the puzzle.
